"""Smooth, continuous joint motion for the xArm 1S.

The xArm servos take "go to P within T ms" commands, and each new command
restarts the move from wherever the servo is. The old approach sent a tiny step
from the GUI timer on every tick. The step size and timing then depended on GUI
load, and the blocking USB writes ran on the GUI thread, so motion was jerky and
laggy.

MotionStreamer runs in its own thread at a fixed rate. Callers only set a
desired velocity per servo (units/s). Every cycle it:
  * ramps each servo's velocity toward the desired one along an S-curve:
    acceleration is limited, and so is how fast the acceleration itself
    changes (jerk), so starts, stops and reversals have no sudden kick,
  * brakes ahead of a soft limit so the joint glides into it instead of
    stopping dead at full speed,
  * moves a float setpoint by velocity * dt, clamped to the soft limits,
  * sends ONE packet that aims every moving servo `lookahead` ahead of its
    setpoint, with duration = lookahead. The servo then moves at the commanded
    speed and never comes to rest between packets.
A servo whose velocity reaches zero gets one last command to its setpoint.
If the GUI stops sending commands (frozen, crashed tick), the arm slows to a stop.

All limits and the hard speed cap are still enforced by SafeArm.
